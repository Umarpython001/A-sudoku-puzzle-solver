LOOP STRUCTURE

To implement backtracking, the function calls itself.

Find an empty cell.
Base Case: If there are no empty cells left, the puzzle is solved! Return True.

    Recursive Step:
    a. Iterate through all possible numbers, from 1 to 9.
    b. For each number, check if it's valid for the empty cell (row, column, and box).
    c. If it's valid, place the number in the grid.
    d. Now, recursively call your function again. This is where the magic happens. You're saying, "If I put this number here, can the rest of the puzzle be solved?"
    e. If that recursive call returns True (meaning it solved the rest of the puzzle), then your job is done. Return True.
    f. If the recursive call returns False (meaning the path led to a dead end), this is the crucial step: backtrack. You must undo the move by setting the cell back to 0.

    Failure: If you've tried all numbers from 1-9 for the current cell and none of them led to a solution, then this path is impossible. Return False to the previous recursive call, telling it to backtrack and try a different number.
